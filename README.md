# House-Price-Prediction-Model
Developed a simple linear regression model in Python using Pandas and Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on features like Lot Area, Overall Quality, and Above Ground Living Area. The model achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.75 on the test set, demonstrating its potential for real estate valuation and market analysis.
# Objective:
Develop a predictive model for house prices based on key property features.
# Methodology:
Utilized a dataset of historical house sales (train.csv).
Selected key features for prediction: Lot Area, Overall Quality, and Above Ground Living Area.
Split data into training and testing sets (80/20 split) using train_test_split.
Trained a Simple Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
# Key Technologies:
Python
Pandas (for data handling)
Scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization - specifically used for visualizing the target variable distribution and model residuals)
# Outcome:
Developed a simple linear regression model to predict SalePrice.
Achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.75 on the test set, indicating that the selected features explain a significant portion of the variance in house prices.
Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
# Business Relevance:
This model can serve as a foundational tool for stakeholders in the real estate market, such as agents, investors, and prospective buyers, by providing data-driven insights into property valuation and market trends.
# Learning:
Hands-on experience with the end-to-end process of building and evaluating a basic regression model.
Understanding the importance of data splitting and model evaluation metrics.
Practical application of core data science libraries in Python.
